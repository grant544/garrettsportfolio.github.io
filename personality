        <h2>My Strongest Trait and Impact</h2>
        <p>One of my strongest traits is that I am responsible, which significantly impacts my academic life. For instance, whenever I am in groups, I ensure that all my group members are able to get tasks done effectively and ensure that they are participating; I take charge. This trait helps me because, with the busy life of a college student, having something to help keep track of all assignments is crucial, and being responsible helps with that.</p>

        <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
        <p>My favorite quote is: "<i>Don't change yourself so that other people will like you. Be yourself so that the right people will love you.</i>". This quote is from a motivational app that I use to get daily affirmations. I chose this quote because many times we try to fit into society and lose ourselves; you don't have to force yourself on people for them to like you. Just be yourself, and the right group will find you eventually.</p>

        <h2>Personality Test Results</h2>
        <p>I took the Keirsey personality test and here are the results:</p>
        <div class="personality-test">
            <img src="../Assets/Screenshot 2024-09-16 235434.png" alt="Personality Test Results">
        </div>
        <p>Reflecting on the test, I believe that the results are valid because, as the test said, I am a guardian. As a guardian, we tend to be cautious, which I am; loyal and down-to-earth, which I am as well. I have OCD, so I pride myself on ensuring that my space is tidy and that those around me are doing okay.</p>
